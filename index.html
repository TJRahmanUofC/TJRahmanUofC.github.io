            <div class="about-content">
                <p>I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Calgary (GPA: 3.56/4.0) with a passion for building robust, scalable software solutions. My journey has taken me from low-level assembly programming and computer architecture to full-stack web development and database systems—giving me a unique perspective on how software works at every layer.</p>
                
                <p>I specialize in leadership-driven development. Whether orchestrating a 20-person Agile team for a self-checkout system, designing normalized database architectures, or achieving 100% test coverage on production code, I've learned that great software requires both technical excellence and effective communication. I don't just write code—I anticipate problems, coordinate teams, and build solutions that last.</p>
                
                <p>My technical toolkit spans multiple domains: I've developed full-stack applications with Python and MySQL, built GUI systems with JavaFX, implemented network protocols in C, analyzed statistical data with Tableau, and even competed in hackathons. But what sets me apart is my approach—I lead projects from concept to deployment, ensuring every team member understands the vision and every line of code serves a purpose.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond academics, I've applied these skills in real-world settings: training teams on complex POS systems at McDonald's, delivering Level 1 technical support for gaming events, and mentoring 50+ new students as an Orientation Leader. These experiences taught me that technology is only as valuable as the people who use it—and that communication and empathy are just as critical as algorithms and data structures.</p>
                
                <p>I'm currently seeking co-op opportunities where I can contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with experienced developers, and continue growing as both a technologist and a leader. Whether it's software development, data analytics, systems engineering, or IT infrastructure—I'm ready to bring technical depth, leadership experience, and a relentless commitment to quality.</p>

                    <h3>Computer Hardware Store</h3>
                    <p class="project-summary">Full-stack web application simulating a hardware store's customer and admin operations with a normalized MySQL database for inventory, employee, and transaction management. Integrated Python backend with responsive frontend for real-time data updates.</p>
                    
                    <div class="project-story" id="story-1">
                        <p><em>Two weeks before our project proposal deadline, my team of three stood at a crossroads—no concrete idea, no direction, just possibilities. I knew we needed leadership.</em></p>
                        
                        <p>I called an emergency meeting. Around that table, we brainstormed entity relationships for different concepts—a library system, a restaurant platform, a hardware store. I drew entity-relationship diagrams for each idea on the whiteboard, mapping out customers, products, transactions. The computer hardware store clicked—it had the perfect complexity: inventory management, employee tracking, customer orders, all interconnected.</p>
                        
                        <p>But I didn't stop there. I insisted on an in-person meeting to finalize every entity, every relationship. We sat for hours, debating: "Should employees have departments?" "How do we handle product categories?" "What about transaction history?" By the end, we had a complete EERM that everyone understood.</p>
                        
                        <p>Halfway through development, before our presentation, I sensed potential chaos. Our frontend developer seemed uncertain about layout. So I asked him: "Can you sketch what you want it to look like? Just rough wireframes." He hesitated but agreed.</p>
                        
                        <p>Weeks later, when he began coding the interface, he pulled me aside: "That sketching exercise you made me do? It saved me. I knew exactly what to build." That moment validated everything—leadership isn't just about organizing meetings; it's about anticipating problems your team doesn't even see yet.</p>
                        
                        <p><em>When we presented our normalized MySQL database with real-time Python backend integration, we weren't just showing code—we were showing the result of foresight, planning, and a team that trusted each other's strengths.</em></p>

                        <p>The first sprint planning meeting proved it. People talked over each other. Task assignments were vague. "Who's handling the barcode scanner?" "What about payment processing?" Nobody knew.</p>
                        
                        <p>We made a decision: divide and conquer. Five major components, four people per team. I became lead of one quartet. But here's what I learned—having four people doesn't automatically make you organized.</p>
                        
                        <p>I started scheduling small stand-ups for just my team. Not the full 20-person circus—just us four. "What did you do yesterday? What's blocking you today?" Simple questions, but they worked. We debugged together. When my teammate's façade module wouldn't integrate with the weighing scale simulation, we huddled around one laptop and worked through it line by line.</p>
                        
                        <p>Other teams saw our rhythm and adopted similar approaches. Suddenly, the 20-person team didn't feel overwhelming—it felt like five coordinated units with clear communication channels.</p>
                        
                        <p><em>On demo day, when our self-checkout system processed its first transaction—scanning barcode, calculating weight, accepting payment—it wasn't just code executing. It was 20 people who had learned to move as one. We hit obstacles, restructured, adapted, and delivered.</em></p>

                    <h3>SASGIG - Student Gamer Tracker</h3>
                    <p class="project-summary">Object-Oriented Data Tracking GUI Program in Java to manage student gamer information. Features JavaFX interface, CSV file import/export, and comprehensive editing capabilities with 100% JUnit 5 test coverage.</p>
                    
                    <div class="project-story" id="story-3">
                        <p><em>SASGIG started as a simple idea: track student gamer information. Build it in Java. Make it work.</em></p>
                        
                        <p>But "make it work" felt too simple for where I was in my journey as a developer. I'd written enough sloppy code in previous courses. This time, I wanted excellence.</p>
                        
                        <p>The CLI version came together quickly—ArrayLists storing student data, CSV file persistence, basic CRUD operations. Functional, but clunky. When I converted it to JavaFX using SceneBuilder, I realized I was building something people might actually use. That raised the stakes.</p>
                        
                        <p>I committed to something ambitious: 100% test coverage with JUnit 5. Not 80%. Not "good enough." One hundred percent.</p>
                        
                        <p>It was tedious. Every method, every edge case, every possible user input error. But here's what happened: testing caught bugs I didn't know existed. That CSV parser? Failed on empty lines. The edit function? Crashed when searching for non-existent IDs. Without comprehensive tests, users would've discovered those bugs. Instead, I found them first.</p>
                        
                        <p><em>When I submitted SASGIG with its polished GUI, modular architecture, and that beautiful "100% coverage" badge in the test report, I wasn't just submitting an assignment. I was proving to myself I'd grown from a student who writes code to a developer who engineers solutions.</em></p>

                <div class="project-card">
                    <h3>Twitter-Like Database</h3>
                    <p class="project-summary">Python and SQL-based CLI application emulating social media features including posts, comments, and user interactions. Designed relational schema with optimized SQL queries for efficient data retrieval and performance.</p>
                    
                    <div class="project-story" id="story-4">
                        <p><em>"Build a Twitter-like database using Python and SQL." The assignment came with relational schemas already designed, but none of us—not one person in our three-person team—had ever written SQL before. And I was the only CS student.</em></p>
                        
                        <p>My teammates were great people, hardworking and motivated, but they didn't know what a CLI application even looked like. So I pulled up SASGIG, a project I was working on at the same time. "See this menu? See how when you enter a number, it triggers a function? That's what we're building."</p>
                        
                        <p>We needed structure. I proposed dividing the work into three files: a CLI startup menu, a backend functionalities file, and a data initialization file. I'd handle the CLI development since I had experience with command-line interfaces. They'd start with the data file—creating tables, populating initial users. For the backend, we split it: I took follow/unfollow functionality, and they tackled posting, liking, and comments.</p>
                        
                        <p>But here's the thing—none of us knew SQL.</p>
                        
                        <p>I started hosting meetings outside of class. Not just quick check-ins—real working sessions where we'd sit together, debug together, write queries together. "Why is this SELECT statement returning nothing?" "How do we JOIN these tables properly?" We'd pull up documentation, test queries in the terminal, break things, fix things.</p>
                        
                        <p>The errors were relentless. Foreign key constraints we didn't understand. INSERT statements that failed silently. JOIN queries that returned duplicate rows. Every time we thought we'd figured it out, a new bug appeared—especially when we started adding quality-of-life features like nested comments and inline reply threads.</p>
                        
                        <p>I wanted to use Git for version control, but my teammates weren't CS students—they'd never touched it. "Can we just share files on Discord?" they asked. It wasn't ideal, but it worked. We adapted.</p>
                        
                        <p>One teammate came up with the solution for password encryption using bcrypt—a project requirement we'd been stuck on. Another debugged a tricky timeline-ordering issue. When they hit walls with their SQL statements during QOL updates, I'd hop on a call and we'd work through it together.</p>
                        
                        <p>By the end, something incredible happened: we were all fluent in SQL. We could write complex JOINs without thinking. We understood FOREIGN KEY relationships intuitively. We'd built a fully functional social media backend with features even we hadn't planned initially—comment threads, immediate tweet replies, graceful error handling.</p>
                        
                        <p>For our technical presentation, we recorded a demo showcasing every feature. Watching it work flawlessly—users logging in, posting tweets, following each other, nested comments flowing perfectly—felt incredible.</p>
                        
                        <p><em>This project taught me that leadership isn't about being the most technical person in the room. It's about meeting your team where they are, creating structure when there's chaos, and learning together. We didn't just build a database—we became developers together.</em></p>

                    <h3>Data Analysis & Visualization</h3>
                    <p class="project-summary">Analyzed real-world dataset with a 4-person team, creating interactive dashboards in Tableau and Excel. Applied data cleaning with OpenRefine and validation techniques to ensure accuracy and translate raw data into actionable insights.</p>
                    
                    <div class="project-story" id="story-5">
                        <p><em>The dataset had 30,000+ entries—customer transactions, timestamps, product categories, everything we needed for compelling analysis. I'd spent hours finding it, vetting its quality, ensuring it was rich enough for visualization. My team of four was excited.</em></p>
                        
<p>We divided responsibilities: I handled data sourcing. Three of us worked together on data cleaning and analysis using OpenRefine and MS Excel, then created visualizations in Tableau and MS Excel. The fourth teammate wrote the technical documentation explaining our methodology.</p>
                        
<p>Weeks passed. We cleaned messy data, built interactive dashboards, and prepared our presentation. Everything looked good.</p>
                        
<p>Then, a few days before submission, I reviewed our documentation draft. Something felt incomplete—the methodology section lacked depth, cleaning steps weren't fully explained, and tool justifications were missing. But here's the thing: none of us really knew how to lead a project like this yet. We didn't know when to speak up, how to give constructive feedback, or what a complete documentation section even looked like.</p>
                        
<p>I saw the gaps but stayed quiet. Maybe someone else would catch it. Maybe it was good enough. We were all learning together, but none of us stepped up to say, "Wait, let's review this as a team before we submit."</p>
                        
<p>When grades came back, the feedback was direct: "Insufficient documentation of cleaning methodology." We'd been marked down significantly—not because our analysis was wrong, but because we hadn't communicated our process clearly.</p>
                        
<p>That failure taught all of us something critical: technical skills alone aren't enough. We needed to learn how to lead, how to question each other constructively, and how to recognize when something needed more attention. We were capable students who simply didn't know yet how to function as a team with shared accountability.</p>

<p>Since that project, I've made it my responsibility to create that structure. I volunteer to lead not because I know everything, but because I learned that someone needs to ask the hard questions: "Is this complete?" "Should we review this together?" "What are we missing?" Leadership isn't about being the smartest person—it's about creating space for the team to catch problems before they become failures.</p>
                        
<p><em>That dataset project earned us a poor grade, but it taught me something more valuable: how to turn a group of individual contributors into a team that holds itself accountable. And that's a lesson I carry into every collaboration.</em></p>
